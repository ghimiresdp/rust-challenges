# Design Patterns

Design patterns are valuable tools for software engineers which are developed
to overcome different recurrent problems saving time and effort while also
improving the quality of overall system.

Design pattern can be defined as a reusable and general solution to a common
problem that occurs during development of software. Design pattern is a
blueprint that provides a set of proven practices and guidelines that help
software engineers design and structure their code to achieve specific goals
which ultimately helps making code more maintainable, extensible and readable.

Some of the design patterns and example code to use in software are as follows:

1. [Singleton Pattern](src/singleton.rs)
2. [Factory Pattern](src/factory.rs)
3. [Builder Pattern]
4. [Decorator Pattern]
5. [Observer Pattern]
6. [Strategy Pattern]
7. [Command Pattern]
8. [Adapter Pattern]
9. [State Pattern]
10. [Prototype Pattern]
11. [Composite Pattern]
12. [Chain of Responsibility Pattern]
13. [Visitor Pattern]
