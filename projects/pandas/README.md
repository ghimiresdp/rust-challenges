# Pandas

Pandas project is a Python Pandas like project with very limited functionality.

It is able to create a basic data frame by one of the following ways:

1. Initializing directly
2. Importing a csv file

As this project is a basic project that will be able to do some very basic ETL
operations such as parsing, typecasting, etc.
