# MINI SQL

`miniSQL` is a simple sql application that will work similar to
the standard SQL application.

It is a CLI application similar to sqlite which has limited features provided by
sql. The main purpose of this application is to learn how to create a sql
compliant application.

_**Note**: all SQL features will not be added to the application since it is
a sample project but not a complete application._
