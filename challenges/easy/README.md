# Rustlang Basic Challenges

The Basic Challenge is generally created for the first-time rust user. Generally,
this package do not install any other external libraries since the solutions
that are seen in this package are relatively easier than other packages.

However, some examples might include some packages since rust standard libraries
might not be sufficient for all problems.

To run each binary, you can run `cargo run` command.

example:

```shell
# to run fibonacci series problem
cargo run --bin fib
# to run practical number problem
cargo run --bin practical_number
```

## Table of Contents

1. [Nth item of a Fibonacci Series](./fib.rs) - `fib`
2. [Practical Number](./practical_number.rs) - `practical_number`
3. [Greatest Common Divisor](./gcd.rs) - `gcd`
4. [Two Sum](./two_sum.rs) - `two_sum`
